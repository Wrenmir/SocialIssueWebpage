            <li>Investments in mental health can help takle the root causes of social and economic imbalances that have a bearing on people's mental health.</li>
            <li>The costs borne by individuals, communities, and even nations illustrate the huge financial burden that mental health problems can present. These expenses include not just the direct costs of medical care but also the indirect costs of lost possibilities for employment, education, and social interaction.</li>
